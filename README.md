### Who are you?
I'm a recent Computer Science graduate with over 8 years of varying degrees of mostly software development & teaching experience.

### Where did you go to school?
I have both a Bachelor's and Master's of Science in Computer Science from Syracuse University. Go üçä.

### What programming languages do you know?
Most of my work is in high-level languages such as Java and C#. I also have experience in lower-level languages a la C/++ and assembly (mostly for static analysis), and purely functional languages such as Haskell.

I have a passion for modifying programs I frequently use (usually video games), so others can enjoy them as I remember it. In addition, I love making small QoL tweaks to benefit the community of games.
